# pvr.vuplus Kodi Add-on on LG-webOS

Enigma2 PVR Add-on for Kodi Compiled for LG webOS

It is not installed by Kodi via .ZIP as usual, but must be copied manually to TV.

Unzip the pvr.vuplus.zip and copy the folder pvr.vuplus to `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.xbmc.kodi/addons/` on the TV using FileZilla. Have fun with it.
